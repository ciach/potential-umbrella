# Implementation plan

Below is the step-by-step plan for implementing the MURDOCK project. This plan is divided into five phases: Environment Setup, Frontend Development, Backend Development, Integration, and Deployment. Each step includes explicit actions, file paths, and validations. Make sure to validate the current project directory before initializing to avoid redundancy.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  **Prevalidate Project Directory**: Check if the current directory already contains a MURDOCK project structure (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, and backend files). (Reference: PRD: Project Overview)

2.  **Install Core Tools**: Tech stack centers on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

4.  **Initialize Project Structure**: Create a basic directory structure if not present:

    *   `/frontend/index.html`
    *   `/frontend/style.css`
    *   `/frontend/script.js`
    *   `/data/transactions.txt` (file to store the transactions; ensure it exists or will be created automatically). (Reference: PRD: Core Features, Data Storage)

5.  **Configure Development IDE (Windsurf)**:

    *   Open the project in Windsurf.
    *   Navigate to the Cascade assistant, tap the hammer (MCP) icon, and open the configuration file.
    *   (Since Supabase/MCP is not needed for this TXT based storage, skip MCP-specific configuration.) (Reference: Tech Stack: Windsurf)

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  **Create Main HTML File**: Create `/frontend/index.html` with a single-page layout. Include a `<form>` element that will contain the transaction inputs. (Reference: PRD: Single-Page Interface)

2.  **Define Transaction Form Fields**: In `index.html`, inside the `<form>`:

    *   Add a text input named `transactions` for comma-separated alphanumeric entries. (Validation: allow alphanumerics, commas, spaces)
    *   Add a text input/textarea named `comment` with a placeholder and a max length of 250 characters. (Validation: Prevent SQL injection)
    *   Add a dropdown `<select>` named `action` with options: ‘STP-Release’, ‘Release’, ‘Block’, ‘Reject’. (Validation: Ensure one selection.)
    *   Add a clearly visible submit `<button>`. (Reference: PRD: Transaction Form)

3.  **Implement Client-Side Validation**: In `/frontend/script.js`, add event listeners to validate:

    *   The `transactions` field uses a regex to allow alphanumeric characters, commas, and spaces.
    *   The `comment` field ensures no SQL specific characters are entered and respects the 250 character limit.
    *   Confirm that an option is selected in the `action` dropdown. (Reference: PRD: Transaction Form, Q&A: Form Handling)

4.  **Design Styling and Dark Mode**: In `/frontend/style.css`, add styles for a clean, data-focused layout. Incorporate a dark mode theme that can be toggled by the user. (Reference: PRD: Visually Compelling, Simple Design)

5.  **Validation of Frontend**: Open `index.html` in a modern browser and test that all form fields load and validate correctly before submission. (Reference: App Flow: Page Load)
