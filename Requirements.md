# MURDOCK Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

MURDOCK is an internal, web-based tool designed to automate the manual process of handling transactions for company staff. The single-page interface streamlines data input and processing, ensuring that employees can quickly and securely process transactions without the hassle of navigating multiple pages. The tool focuses on simplicity and reliability by providing a compelling yet functional design that caters to the internal teams.

The purpose of MURDOCK is to replace a manual workflow with an automated system that writes transaction data to a TXT file, ensuring integrity and security throughout the process. The project is built to deliver a lightweight, fast, and secure solution that meets the specific needs of the company’s internal teams. Key objectives include enforcing strict data validation on a simple form, ensuring secure data handling via encryption and logging, and providing an intuitive, data-focused user experience with design considerations such as dark mode.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   A single-page web tool that automates transaction processing.

*   A form with three primary fields:

    *   Transaction details: a text field accepting comma-separated alphanumeric entries.
    *   Comment: an optional text field limited to 250 characters to prevent overflow and security issues.
    *   Action: a dropdown menu with predefined choices ('STP-Release', 'Release', 'Block', 'Reject') with validation to ensure one option is always selected.

*   Saving and appending validated form data into a TXT file in a structured format.

*   Implementation of basic yet robust data validations on form submissions.

*   A functional, data-driven layout featuring clear tables, filter controls, and an intuitive navigation bar.

*   Design support for dark mode to reduce eye strain.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Complex multi-page navigation or additional dashboards.
*   Integration with external databases or third-party APIs for data storage (only TXT file storage is covered).
*   Advanced authentication systems, as the tool is intended for internal use with assumed basic authentication measures.
*   Advanced reporting or analytics beyond the form submission and data logging.
*   Extensive customization of design elements beyond the specified functional and dark mode options.

## 3. User Flow

When a company staff member accesses MURDOCK, they are greeted with a clean, single-page layout designed for ease of use. The homepage immediately presents a central form along with a navigation bar and clear data presentation elements such as tables and filter controls. The user sees options to switch between regular and dark modes early on, making it adaptable to their work environment.

A new user (or an existing one) begins by filling out the transaction form. They enter transaction details as comma-separated values into the designated field, add any optional comments, and select an appropriate action from the dropdown menu. Once the user submits the form, the system validates all data inputs, securely appends the information to a TXT file, and logs the transaction actions for security and audit purposes. The straightforward flow ensures a fast, efficient, and secure transaction processing experience.

## 4. Core Features

*   **Single-Page Interface:**\
    A dedicated page that centralizes all operations, reducing distractions and simplifying navigation.

*   **Transaction Form:**\
    A user form consisting of:

    *   **Transaction Field:** Accepts comma-separated alphanumeric values with strict character validations.
    *   **Comment Field:** An optional input with a maximum limit of 250 characters and security validations to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Action Dropdown:** Preloaded choices of 'STP-Release', 'Release', 'Block', and 'Reject' with enforced valid selection.

*   **Data Saving to TXT File:**\
    The submitted and validated form data is appended to a TXT file in a structured and human-readable format, ensuring that data can be easily reviewed and processed later.

*   **Visual and Functional Design:**\
    Simple, clear, and data-focused layout with an intuitive navigation bar, table views, filter controls, and a dark mode option to minimize eye strain.

*   **Security and Logging:**\
    Secure data transmission and at-rest encryption, complemented by regular audits and detailed logging of transactions.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend:**

    *   Simple HTML for structure.
    *   Plain JavaScript for interactivity and form validation.
    *   CSS for styling, including support for dark mode.

*   **Backend / Data Handling:**

    *   Direct file manipulation using server-side scripting to save form submissions to a TXT file.
    *   Basic encryption libraries to ensure that data is secured during transmission and at rest.

*   **AI Integration & Development Tools:**

    *   Windsurf as the modern IDE with integrated AI coding capabilities.
    *   Claude 3.7 Sonnet for advanced reasoning and offering coding assistance when needed.
    *   GPT-4o for coding support and to generate and review code snippets as required.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   Lightweight design with streamlined code ensuring fast load times and quick response during data submission.
    *   Minimal dependencies to keep the system performant within an internal network.

*   **Security:**

    *   Data encryption during both transmission and while stored in the TXT file.
    *   Input validations to prevent harmful data (such as SQL injection) and ensure data consistency.
    *   Comprehensive logging for tracking all user actions and form submissions.

*   **Usability:**

    *   A simple, intuitive user interface that minimizes cognitive load.
    *   Dark mode option for employees who work long hours.
    *   Clear visual cues and responsive design to guarantee ease of use.

*   **Compliance:**

    *   Adherence to basic internal data security policies, ensuring that only authorized company staff can access and use the tool.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   The tool is an internal application designed for use by company staff only.
    *   Data is stored in a TXT file instead of a database, which might limit scalability.
    *   Implementation is limited to a lightweight tech stack (HTML, JavaScript, CSS), which may restrict advanced functionalities.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   It is assumed that basic network-level security measures are in place for internal use.
    *   The availability of encryption libraries and secure file I/O operations on the server.
    *   Users have access to modern web browsers that fully support HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
    *   The internal team has minimal training needs given the simple and intuitive design of the tool.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **File-Based Data Storage:**

    *   Potential issues with concurrent writes to the TXT file may require careful handling. Consider implementing file locks or ensuring timestamp-based file management to prevent data corruption.

*   **Security Vulnerabilities:**

    *   The simplistic tech stack and direct file writing may expose vulnerabilities if not properly secured. Ensure that proper server-side encryption and validations are effectively implemented.

*   **Input Validation Risks:**

    *   Despite strict client-side validations, server-side issues (e.g., injection attacks) could still pose a risk. Always perform comprehensive validations on the backend.

*   **Scalability Limitations:**

    *   The reliance on TXT file storage could become a bottleneck as transaction volume increases. Future iterations might consider switching to a lightweight database if scalability becomes an issue.

*   **UI/UX Concerns:**

    *   Balancing a visually compelling design with a functional, data-focused approach may require iterative design testing with internal users to fine-tune usability and aesthetics.

Mitigation strategies include thorough testing (both automated and manual), rigorous security audits, and potentially planning for future phases that could integrate a more robust data management system if needed.
